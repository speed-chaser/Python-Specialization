# Python Specialization

## First Task

### Task Goals:

- Create developer virtual environment to avoid package version conflicts
- Create python file with python program to add two numbers using basic python syntax

### Exercise 1.1 Files:

- add.py file that adds two numbers
- requirements.txt holds dependencies for virtual environemnt
- screenshot of python version, new virtual environment and installing ipython to the environment

### Exercise 1.2: Recipe Data Structure

#### Task Overview:

This exercise focuses on building a basic data structure to store recipe information for a Recipe app. The primary goals are to:

- Understand and apply different Python data structures (lists, dictionaries).
- Create a structured format to store and access recipe data.
- Practice sequential storage and retrieval of data within Python.

#### Task Steps and Responing:

Data STructure for Individual Recipes(`recipe_1`, to `recipe_5`):

- Structure Used: Dictionary
- Why: Dictionaries in Python allow for a clear and accessible way to store key-value pairs. Each recipe has attributes like name, cooking time, and ingredients, making dictionaries an ideal choice for structuring this data.

Data Structure for Storing All Recipes (all_recipes):

- Structure Used: List
- Why: A list is suitable for storing a sequence of items. It allows for easy addition, removal, and iteration over recipes. This sequential nature is essential for a collection like a recipe book where the order can be important and modifications are common.

#### Exercise 1.2 Files:

- Python script containing the code for creating recipes and the all_recipes list.
- Screenshot of each step demonstrating the creation of data structures and their outputs.
- Updated learning journal reflectign on the exercise.
